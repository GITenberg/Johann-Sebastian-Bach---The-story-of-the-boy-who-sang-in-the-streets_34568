BACH was born.</p>

<span class="caption">THE HOUSE IN WHICH BACH WAS BORN.</span>
</div>

<p>This house stands in the town of Eisenach in
Germany. It looks very much the same today as it
did when Sebastian was a little boy. Many people
go there to visit this house because the little boy
grew to be a famous man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
In Eisenach there is a statue of Bach near the
palace.</p>

<span class="caption">STATUE OF BACH AT EISENACH.</span>
</div>

<p>In the same town in which Sebastian was born
there stands on the top of a hill a very famous castle
built many hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>This castle is called the Wartburg.</p>

<img src="images/illus04.jpg"  alt="THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG." title="THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG." /><br />
<span class="caption">THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG.</span>
</div>

<p>As a boy little Sebastian used to climb the hill with
his friends, and they, no doubt, had a happy time playing
about the castle grounds. In one of its great halls
the minstrels of Germany held their Song Contests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
When Sebastian was old enough he used to
travel afoot, just as the minstrels did; his purpose
was to go to hear fine organ players. Once as he
sat weary by the roadside someone threw a herring
to him so that he might eat as he rested.</p>

<p>Little Sebastian's father was named JOHANN
AMBROSIUS BACH. He, too, was a musician, as
his people had been for many years.</p>

One of these was a miller who played and sang
while the corn was grinding. His name was Veit
Bach, and his little boy was called Hans, the Player,
because he, too, loved to play the violin.</p>

<p>When Sebastian was ten years old his father
and mother died. So he went to live with his brother,
whose home was a few miles away.</p>

<p>Of this brother Sebastian had music lessons, and
he improved so rapidly that he used to beg to be allowed
to play the pieces in a big book in the library.</p>

<p>But the brother refused him this pleasure. However,
little Sebastian was eager to learn all the music
he could find, so he used to sit up on moonlight nights
and copy these pages while his brother was asleep.</p>

<p>But what do you think happened when he had
copied everything in that big book?</p>

<p>His brother found out what he had done and
took all his precious music away from him.</p>

<p>If you know any boy who is about twenty years
old you may say to him, Bach was as old as you are
when Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston.</p>

<p>And although there was this difference of twenty
years or so in their ages, we may think of them at
work in the world at the same time. You must remember
that all men like Franklin and Bach who
became famous did so by working very hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<span class="caption">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Franklin, too, was born very poor. Once he
walked the streets of Philadelphia with a loaf of
bread under each arm. But by being faithful in all
he did he became the friend of all his countrymen
and of Kings and Queens besides.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was quite a little younger
than Sebastian Bach. But there was a famous man
who was almost exactly Sebastian's age. This man
composed an Oratorio that is loved by everybody. It
is sung in cities and towns all over the world, particularly
at Christmas time.</p>

<p>Do you happen to know the name of this Oratorio?
If not, you can surely learn it by asking someone
or by looking it up in a book.</p>

<p>Write in the name of the composer of this
Oratorio below the picture, and write on this line the
name of the Oratorio itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
The Oratorio, the name of which you have just
written, was first sung in the Irish city of Dublin, 1742.</p>

<p>At that time Sebastian Bach was living in Leipsic
and had been for many years at the head of the
Thomas School. He was known as its Cantor. Bach
worked very hard here to supply music for several of
the Leipsic churches, and he worked so well that his
fame spread until it reached the ears of the Emperor.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great was also a musician and
composer. So he invited Sebastian Bach to visit him
at his castle. There were many people present, but
Sebastian Bach was the principal guest. He played
on many of the Emperor's fine pianos. When he
reached home again he composed a musical work
and dedicated it to the Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
The kind of a piano that Sebastian Bach played
on was not called a piano in his day. It was called
a Clavier or Clavichord.</p>

<p>Some day you will study a collection of pieces by
Sebastian Bach which was written for this instrument
and was called <i>The Well Tempered Clavichord</i>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of piano, or clavichord, that
Bach used.</p>

<p>Sebastian Bach had a very large family, twenty
children altogether. Two of them studied music
faithfully with their father.</p>

<p>One was Friedmann, for whom the father
wrote a book called <i>Little Preludes</i>. Friedmann's
brother, Philipp Emanuel Bach, was a very fine
clavichord player. He wrote a book about music
and composed many pieces.</p>

Sebastian Bach died in 1750. He was sixty-five
years of age.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was at that time forty-four
years old and George Washington was eighteen.</p>

<p>This is the way Bach wrote his name.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
